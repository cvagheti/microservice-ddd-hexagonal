and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-26

### Added
- **CQRS Implementation**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern
  - `ProductCommandUseCase` interface for write operations
  - `ProductQueryUseCase` interface for read operations  
  - `ProductCommandAdapter` specialized for command operations
  - `ProductQueryAdapter` specialized for query operations
  - `ProductCommandService` for write-side application logic
  - `ProductQueryService` for read-side application logic (read-only transactions)

### Enhanced
- **Hexagonal Architecture**
  - Multiple specialized adapters for different responsibilities
  - Improved separation between command and query concerns
  - Enhanced port definitions with CQRS pattern

### Updated
- **Documentation**
  - Comprehensive README update with CQRS implementation details
  - New architectural diagrams showing command/query separation
  - Updated API endpoints documentation with adapter usage information
  - Enhanced benefits section highlighting CQRS advantages
  - Updated technology stack documentation
  - Detailed implementation examples and usage patterns

### Architectural Improvements
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Commands and queries now have dedicated paths
- **Enhanced Performance**: Specialized services for read and write operations
- **Improved Testability**: Separate testing strategies for commands vs queries
- **Greater Flexibility**: Independent optimization of read and write sides

## [1.1.0] - Previous Version

### Added
- Domain-Driven Design implementation with pure domain layer
- Hexagonal Architecture with ports and adapters
- Spring Boot 3.1.5 with Java 21
- Multi-module Maven structure (domain, application, infrastructure)
- Product aggregate root with value objects (ProductId, Money, ProductStatus)
- Repository pattern with JPA implementation
- REST API endpoints with comprehensive CRUD operations
- H2 database for development, PostgreSQL for production
- Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring

### Features
- Product management with business rules
- Stock management with validation
- Product status lifecycle (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, DISCONTINUED)
- Inventory statistics calculation
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

## Architecture Evolution

### From Single Service to CQRS
- **Before**: Single `ProductApplicationService` handling all operations
- **After**: Specialized services for commands (`ProductCommandService`) and queries (`ProductQueryService`)
- **Benefits**: Better performance, clearer responsibilities, easier testing

### From Single Adapter to Specialized Adapters  
- **Before**: Single `ProductUseCaseAdapter` implementing `ProductManagementUseCase`
- **After**: Multiple adapters:
  - `ProductUseCaseAdapter` for unified interface
  - `ProductCommandAdapter` for write operations
  - `ProductQueryAdapter` for read operations
- **Benefits**: CQRS support, specialized optimizations, cleaner code

### Documentation Improvements
- **Enhanced Diagrams**: New mermaid diagrams showing CQRS flow
- **Implementation Details**: Step-by-step CQRS implementation explanation
- **Usage Guidelines**: When to use each adapter type
- **Performance Benefits**: Detailed explanation of CQRS advantages
